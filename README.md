## Overview

This challenge asks that I create a signup form that uses JavaScript to check for format validity and empty fields, with error messages shown.

## Focus

My focus here is to build on my knowledge of HTML forms and client-side validation. I've done a project previously with validity checks - see [Ping-coming-soon](https://github.com/i000o/ping-coming-soon.git). This one includes a password and more input fields.

## Outcome

I'm happy with the outcome. It didn't take too much time. I felt more practiced using validity checks, I understand more the JavaScript I'm writing. Styling is easy and I can do it with confidence, but I can always learn more about Flex layouts. The media queries on this one took me some time. I'm happy with the way I worked through the error messages which show on incorrect inputs, too.

## Lessons

1. `novalidate` - _"The novalidate attribute is a way to tell the browser: 'Donâ€™t handle the form validation for me.'... When you add `novalidate`, you're instructing the browser to bypass the automatica validation. That means you take full control of how to validate the input fields."_ AI explaination I found useful on this. I learnt this debugging why my error message `<span>`'s weren't showing up.
2. The important of space/no space with CSS combinator selectors. For instance, I had written `input .input-error` which was wrong becaused this calls for descendants of `<input>`. Instead, I needed to remove the space, making a compound selector which looks for _both_, rather that one within the other.
3. `<input type="password">` for passwords to obscure the text.
4. I think the media queries took me the longest. I had to work through them breakpoint by breakpoint. I don't normally do them this way, but I found it most effective. Although it takes time and focus, it's worth it to make the layout fully flow nicely throughout viewports. I want to get much better and faster at these in future.
